# schwab-sdk

Typed Rust client for the [Charles Schwab Trader API][trader] and its
streamer WebSocket.

- REST endpoints for accounts, orders, transactions, user preferences, and the
  full market-data surface (quotes, price history, option chains, instruments,
  market hours, movers).
- A streaming client for the Schwab streamer with typed payloads for the
  level-one, book, chart, screener, and account-activity services.
- All money and quantity fields use [`rust_decimal::Decimal`]; secrets are
  wrapped in [`secrecy`] newtypes that redact in `Debug` and zeroize on drop.

What this crate does **not** do:

- It does not perform the OAuth authorization flow. Bring your own access
  token; see Schwab's developer portal for the auth-code / refresh-token
  flow.
- It does not retry failed requests. Each `Error` exposes
  [`is_retryable`](https://docs.rs/schwab-sdk/latest/schwab_sdk/enum.Error.html#method.is_retryable)
  and `retry_after` so callers can layer a policy of their choice
  (e.g. `backon`) on top.
- It does not rate-limit. Schwab does not publish per-endpoint limits at
  the time of writing; callers are responsible for staying within them.
